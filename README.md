- 👋 Hi, I’m @esmattu
- 👀 I’m interested in software developement that's a given. Also intrested in games, painting models (40K) and playing rugby.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and .Net Core looking build up a portfolio of work. Any hints or ideas on what else I can add is welcome.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will help develop my skills and knowledge with C# and .Net Core. Hopefully we can work on something cool.
- 📫 How to reach me for now just message me through github.
